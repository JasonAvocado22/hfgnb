<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_anaconda">The green anaconda is the world's heaviest and one of the world's longest snakes, reaching a length of up to 5.21 m (17.1 ft) long. Primarily aquatic, they eat a wide variety of prey, almost anything they can manage to overpower, including fish, amphibians, birds, a variety of mammals, and other reptiles.Particularly large anacondas may consume large prey such as tapirs, deer, capybaras, and caimans, but such large meals are not regularly consumed.</blockquote>
