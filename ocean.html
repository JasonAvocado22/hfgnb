<h1>The Pacific Ocean Exhibit </h1>
<p>The Pacific Ocean is home to many fish and aquatic mammals. On display we have 2 of the most unique animals of the Pacific Ocean!</p>

    <br>
    Identification: <br>
    The Dugong is a large, grey brown bulbous animal with a flattened fluked tail, like that of a whale, no dorsal fin, paddle like flippers and distinctive head shape. The broad flat muzzle and mouth are angled down to enable ease of grazing along the seabed. Eyes and ears are small reflecting the animal's lack of reliance on these senses. <br>
    <br>
    Habitat: <br>
    Dugongs prefer wide shallow bays and areas protected by large inshore islands. Vagrant animals will occasionally appear as far south as southern New South Wales and near Perth in Western Australia. <br>
    <br>
    Distribution:
    The Dugong is found over a broad range of the coastal and inland waters of the western Indo-Pacific region. In Australia, they occur in an arc from Moreton Bay in southern Queensland across northern Australia to Shark Bay in northern Western Australia.</blockquote>
<h3>The Californian Sea Lion</h3>

<blockquote cite="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/california-sea-lion">The clichéd circus seal—obligingly balancing a ball on its nose and jumping through hoops—is typically a California sea lion. <br>
    <br>
    But in the wild, the California sea lion is a sleek animal, faster than any other sea lion or seal. These eared seals top out at speeds of some 25 miles an hour. Unlike other sea lions, California sea lions do not have lionlike manes. <br>
    <br>
    California Sea Lion Colonies <br>
    <br>
    These pinnipeds live along the rocky Pacific Ocean coastlines of western North America. Huge colonies can be seen gathered on seaside rocks, and even on man-made structures, for breeding and for birthing. Males gather harems of females to their sides in competition to sire young pups, which are born on land. <br>
    <br>

    Aquatic Adaptations <br>
    <br>
    The sea lion's ancient ancestors, like those of whales and dolphins, lived on land. The modern animal is well adapted to an aquatic environment, with its streamlined body and powerful flippers. (The rear flippers rotate forward to allow a California sea lion to move surprisingly well on land.) California sea lions also boast thick layers of blubber to insulate their bodies from the chill of marine waters.
    <br>
    When diving deep, California sea lions slow their heart rates to allow them to remain underwater for nearly ten minutes before surfacing to breathe. This ability gives them an edge in the pursuit of the fish, squid, and shellfish that make up their primary diet.</blockquote>
