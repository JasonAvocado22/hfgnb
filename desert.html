<h1>Death Valley Exhibit</h1>
<p>The Death Valley is home to many species of insects and reptiles, here are 2 of our featured species!</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2075275-devils-hole-pupfish-might-be-reincarnated-even-if-it-died-out/">This pupfish, Cyprinodon diabolis, lives in a single pool in the middle of Death Valley, the hottest place on Earth. We had assumed it had been clinging to isolated existence at that site since the glaciers receded and the valley dried up 10,000 years ago. But its genes tell a different story. <br>
    <br>
    The species is actually a newcomer, having colonised the hole from nearby springs – and then diverged from its ancestors – within the past few hundred years. It has also been exchanging genes with related species of pupfish in nearby springs, despite the hot, dry desert separating them. <br>
    <br>
    This may have happened during floods, or fish or their eggs may have been carried between springs by birds or humans, says Christopher Martin at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, whose team analysed DNA from pupfish species in the area.<br>
    <br>
    This new genetic picture may change the way conservationists manage Death Valley’s endangered pupfish species.<br>
    <br>
    Devil’s Hole is a rock fissure just 22 metres long and 3.5 metres wide leading to a vast flooded cavern whose bottom hasn’t yet been found. Within its warm, dark, oxygen-poor waters live the C. diabolis pupfish, whose numbers fluctuate from a few dozen to a few hundred, making them one of the most endangered vertebrates on the planet.

<blockquote cite="https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Mammals/Bighorn-Sheep/Desert">From the arid desert of the Mojave to the snowy heights of the Sierras, California is home to diverse populations of bighorn sheep. The state hosts two subspecies: desert bighorn (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) and Sierra Nevada bighorn (Ovis canadensis sierrae). This website explores the natural history, current population status, and conservation efforts surrounding California’s desert bighorn sheep.</blockquote>
