<blockquote cite="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/polar-bear">The largest bear in the world and the Arctic's top predator, polar bears are a powerful symbol of the strength and endurance of the Arctic. The polar bear's Latin name, Ursus maritimus, means "sea bear." It's an apt name for this majestic species, which spends much of its life in, around, or on the oceanâ€“predominantly on the sea ice. In the United States, Alaska is home to two polar bear subpopulations.</blockquote>

<h3>The Walrus</h3>

<blockquote cite="https://arcticwwf.org/species/walrus/">The walrus is a pinniped, or fin-footed mammal, and is related to seals and sea lions. Their skin is covered by a thin layer of small coarse hair.<br>
    <br>
    Amazing teeth <br>
    <br>
    Their most remarkable features are the long tusks which are surrounded by a mat of stiff bristles. The tusks are used for keeping breathing holes in the ice open, for fighting and for helping the walruses haul themselves out of the water on to an ice floe. <br>
    <br>
    Habitat and Ecology <br>
    <br>
    Walrus migrate with the moving ice floes, but never venture far from the coast as they feed in shallow waters. They can swim to a depth of around 100m to feed on molluscs and other invertebrates, but on average do not go much deeper than 20-30m</blockquote>
