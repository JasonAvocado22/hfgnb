<h1>The Amazon Rainforest Exhibit</h1>
<p>The Amazon rainforest is beutiful but dangerous place. From snakes big enough to eat a human whole to pink dolphins, the Amazon rainforest has some of the coolest animals on earth! </p>
<h3>Amazon River Dolphins</h3>

<blockquote cite="https://www.delfinamazoncruises.com/about-the-amazon/pink-river-dolphins-the-amazon/">Yes, Amazon river dolphins are pink. Scientists are not entirely sure why, but a common theory suggests that their rosy pigment comes from their blood vessels visible through a thin layer of skin. In fact, Amazon river dolphins become more pink in color when excited, much like humans when we blush. <br>
    <br>
    These dolphins are an endemic species to the Amazon Rainforest, meaning that they are not found in any other part of the world. While there are other freshwater dolphins in places like China and parts of Southeast Asia, there are only 2 documented species living in the Amazon Basin of South America. Of those 2 species, the pink river dolphin is the most charismatic. <br>
    <br>
    In all honesty, the pink river dolphin is not the cutest water-dwelling animal of the Amazon. These dolphins are larger than a person, about 8 feet long, with a bulge on the head and a long, thin snout that is curved upwards, as if it is permanently smiling. They have large flippers and a short crest where the dorsal fin should be. They are not particularly fast swimmers, but their unique bone structure allows them to maneuver with agility through trees and brush when the river floods during the high water season.</blockquote>
<h3>Poison Dart Frog</h3>

<blockquote cite="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/amphibians/facts/poison-dart-frogs-1">Poison dart frogs, members of the Dendrobatidae family, wear some of the most brilliant and beautiful colors on Earth. Depending on individual habitats, which extend from the tropical forests of Costa Rica to Brazil, their coloring can be yellow, gold, copper, red, green, blue, or black. Their elaborate designs and hues are deliberately ostentatious to ward off potential predators, a tactic called aposematic coloration. <br>
    <br>
    Parenting Behavior: <br>
    Some species display unusual parenting habits, including carrying both eggs and tadpoles on their backs. Although this "backpacking" is not unique among amphibians, male poison dart frogs are exceptional in their care, attending to the clutch, sometimes exclusively, and performing vital transportation duties. <br>
    <br>
    Toxicity: <br>
    Dendrobatids include some of the most toxic animals on Earth. The two-inch-long golden poison frog has enough poison to kill 10 grown men. Indigenous Ember√° people of Colombia have used its powerful poison for centuries to tip their blowgun darts when hunting, hence the genus' common name. <br>
    <br>
    Scientists are unsure of the source of poison dart frogs' toxicity, but it is possible they assimilate plant poisons which are carried by their prey, including ants, termites and beetles. Poison dart frogs raised in captivity and isolated from insects in their native habitat never develop poison. <br>
    <br>
    The medical research community has been exploring possible medicinal uses for some poison dart frog poison. They have already developed a synthetic version of one compound that shows promise as a painkiller.</blockquote>
